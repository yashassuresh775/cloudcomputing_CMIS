# Public assets

- **Background image (optional):** To use a Texas A&M logo or building photo as the page background, add an image file here (e.g. `tamu-bg.png` or `tamu-bg.jpg`) and in `src/app.css` set:

  ```css
  :root {
    --bg-image: url('/tamu-bg.png');
  }
  ```

  Use a high-resolution image; it will be shown at low opacity (12%) so content stays readable. For the official TAMU logo, use only approved assets from [TAMU Brand Guidelines](https://brand.tamu.edu/).
